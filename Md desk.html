<p >“Hyderabad is a blend of architectural marvels, rich cultural heritage, delectable cuisines and exquisite textiles that are celebrated all over the world. A reflection of the city’s grandeur, in modern times, is Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR), an amalgamation of cutting edge technology, automation and engineering expertise. It is the world’s largest public-private partnership (PPP) project in the Metro Rail sector, that will cover a distance of seventy-two kilometers. Eco-friendly and safe, HMR will effectively address traffic issues and reduce carbon footprints using Regenerative Braking Technology (RBT) and Communication Based Train Control (CBTC).<br>
    <br>

In addition to Transit Oriented Development (TOD), parking facilities and corridors with elevators, escalators and staircases, facilitate seamless commuting for all, including differently-abled and elderly passengers. Automated Fare Collection (AFC) system aids hassle-free station entry and exit with minimal waiting time. HMR will further connect major points in the city, including corporate offices, academic institutions and retail spaces. Growth of ancillary industries, in and around Metro station premises, is also expected to generate ample employment opportunities<br>
<br>

My City, My Metro, My Pride is the brand mantra of HMR that focuses on an operationally aligned, economically viable and people-oriented project development, which will accelerate holistic growth of the city. It will improve the commuting experience of the citizens of Hyderabad by providing a safer, faster and comfortable mode of public transport.<br>
