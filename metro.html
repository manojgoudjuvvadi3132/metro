        <P>Citizen mobility plays an important role in the development of a metropolis and Hyderabad is no exception.
            Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) is an initiative to meet the growing needs of transportation in Hyderabad. Based
            on Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS), the Metro Rail Project will reduce traffic congestion across Hyderabad,
            lower pollution level and improve the livability index of Hyderabad. This ambitious Project was awarded to
            Larsen & Turbo (L&T). A special purpose vehicle, L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad Limited (LTMRHL), was incorporated
            as “the concessionaire” to enter into an agreement with the then Government of Andhra Pradesh on 4th
            September, 2010, for implementation of the Project under Design-Built-Finance-Operate-Transfer (DBFOT)
            basis. A dazzling example of efficient public transport system, HMR is a marvel of modern engineering that
            will add a new dimension to the city of Hyderabad.</P>
